### ðŸ”· **Event Flow (3 Phases)**

1. **Capture Phase (Capturing/Bubbling from top to target):**

   * Event travels **from document â†’ target element**
   * Use: `addEventListener(event, handler, true)`

2. **Target Phase:**

   * Event reaches the **actual element** that was triggered

3. **Bubble Phase (Bubbling):**

   * Event bubbles **back from target â†’ document**
   * Default phase for `addEventListener(event, handler)`
